This is a personal passion project of mine. The idea of how frameworks work always interested me, so yeah... I'm building one myself to gain a deeper understanding and also because I get a lot of enjoyment out of it. This is my venture into building a modern, light weight framework. 

As of right now, the current release has an almost complete lexing phase. The parsing phase is currently being iterated on. 

So far, the lexer can correctly tokenize basic JSX format.
