This is a personal passion project of mine. The idea of how frameworks work always interested me, so yeah... I'm building one myself to gain a deeper understanding and also because I get a lot of enjoyment out of it. This is my venture into building a modern, light weight framework. 

As of right now, the current release has an almost complete lexing phase. The structure of the code could be improved, but as of right now I'm just hacking away to get the mvp out. The parsing phase is currently being iterated on. 

So far, the lexer can correctly tokenize basic JSX format --with newlines and spaces between elements, but no element attributes.

I've studied some of the engineering philsophies of multiple frameworks, and React really set itself apart due to its elegant and simple design. It probably is overkill in a lot of scenarios, but React without a doubt revolutionized frontend development and set the standard for others to follow. From v-dom diffing, jsx, bundling and transpilation processes, and more. A truly all-in-one solution to developing frontend ui's was made. You just code in JavaScript since everything is JavaScript in React. And while there can be many pitfalls to this convention, there is something very alluring to this way of doing things.
